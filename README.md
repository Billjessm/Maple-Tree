# FAQ

#### What is this?
- A small set of applications created specifically for Cemu, an experimental Wii U emulator. Designed to make Wii U title management as easy as possible, and mininal intervention.

#### What does it do?
- It gives you the power to backup Wii U updates, DLC, and titles directly to your PC, as well as launch Cemu with titles.

#### What makes this any different from Wii U USB Helper?
- In short, USB Helper requires a lot of manual steps in order to prep the files for Cemu 1.7.3's patch and DLC feature. 

- Prior to 1.7.3, in order to update titles and add DLC(which didn't always work), you had to overwrite files of the original title. This application removes all the manual work required to get updates and DLC up and running for Cemu 1.7.3 with just a few simple clicks.

#### I see multiple versions on the releases page. Which one should I use?
- Each version is described below, look at their feature set and decide which one best fits you.
