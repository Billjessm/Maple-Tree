# FAQ

### Error: The Process cannot access the file mapleseed.db
- Check your Task Manager and virus protection, to ensure MapleSeed is not running in the background or being accessed by another program.

### What is this?
- A small set of applications created specifically for Cemu, an experimental Wii U emulator. Designed to make Wii U title management as easy as possible, and mininal intervention.

### What does it do?
- It gives you the power to backup Wii U updates, DLC, and titles directly to your PC, as well as launch Cemu with titles.

### What makes this any different from Wii U USB Helper?
- In short, USB Helper requires a lot of manual steps in order to prep the files for Cemu 1.7.3's patch and DLC feature.

### I can't launch a title(s). | I'm getting an error when launching titles!
- Make sure your entire directory path doesn't have special accented characters, such as á, é, í, ó, ú, ü, ñ, ¿, ¡. It's not limited to these characters. But to be safe and avoid issues. Ensure the directory paths only contain alphanumeric characters(a,e,i,o,u,0,1,2,3, etc).

### I can't get MapleSeed v2 to run, but v1 works fine.
- If you're using RivaTuner Statistics Server, add an exception to exclude MapleSeed or close it while using MS. This is an issue that effects all, if not most WPF applications, and to my knowledge, can't be fix via MapleSeed.

 ### What makes this any different from Wii U USB Helper?
- Prior to 1.7.3, in order to update titles and add DLC(which didn't always work), you had to overwrite files of the original title. This application removes all the manual work required to get updates and DLC up and running for Cemu 1.7.3 with just a few simple clicks.

### I see multiple versions on the releases page. Which one should I use?
